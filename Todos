- Automate self.Options to match all the available Tables in the DB     #used in command loop for the first time
- Automate the process of adding/maybe editing another Option via the programm
-Add a .exe file













DONE:
    - Add count for all Objects added --> DB
    - Add a way to return (print out?, put in box with copy button) the gesamt table, so they dont have to check the .db file
    - Sort the data? Alphabetically? GROUP BY? By amount?
    - Transfer the whole programm to a good-looking tkinter GUI
